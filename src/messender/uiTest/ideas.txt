[LAUCHING THE APP] 

    The application will start by creating the user's server using a port that isn't use. The program will scatter 
    for unused ports while their a loading screen playing and I think that it can take a while. To parry the wait I'll include a
    loading bar describing what the program is doing. 
     => Creating 2 Thread : one for the creation of the user's server and one for the loading bar description

       - Server Creation : has an LoadingBar attribute where he can set the descriptive text of whats happening
       - LoadingBar : has a boolean to make it stop animating for when the user server creation is finished

[HEADER / NAVBAR]
    Adding 3 icons on the header :
        => PLUS icon to add a friend
        => SEND icon to send message to a friend
        => THEME icon to change the theme color
        - make sure the icons have a white and black version for when changing themes

[SEND]
    - list of the different friend
    - you can choose to discuss with a friend
    - verifies if friend online

[ADD]
    - you will need a hostname and port to send a friend request
    - notify if the targeted person cannot be reached (the hostname or port is wrong)
    - notify when you foud someone
    - while the friend request isnt accepted, the reciever wont recieve the messages
    - waiting list of people you asked to become friend
    - surname possible (needs to be unique) 

[THEMES]
    There will be multiple themes a pink one, blue one and trans one + a personnable one :D 
        - you can change the header, message color, background color, etc...
